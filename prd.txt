Project: Operations Management System 
Client: Dominion Seedstars Nig LTD

1. Overview 
Dominion Seedstars Nig LTD operates through multiple branches across Nigeria. The Head 
Office (HO) oversees and manages the financial and operational performance of each Branch 
(BR). 
The goal of this system is to automate branch daily reporting, provide real-time visibility 
into financial and loan operations, and simplify reconciliation between Head Office and 
branches. 
2. Objectives 
● Enable branches to input daily operations data (savings, loan collection, disbursement, 
withdrawals, etc.) 
● Allow Head Office to track and monitor each branch’s daily performance 
● Automatically compute totals, summaries, and cash flow balances 
● Provide both HO and BR with dashboards reflecting real-time metrics 
● Eliminate manual reporting (Excel) by replacing it with a centralized web system
